# Facebook Friends
In this project mutual friends are found out using apache hadoop framework. This project incoporates the concept of custom Writables, Pairs of Writables,ArrayWritables and JSONParsing. The entries in the input are of the following format:
Person1 \t His list of friends
Person2 \t His list of friends
.......

Following are the steps involved in this project:
1. Friend Class is created which implements WritableComparable interface. This class contains the basic information of a person or his friend.
2. FriendPair Class is created which also implements WritableComparable interface and uses Friend Class. This class is used as the Output key of the progarm.
3. FriendArray class is created which extends ArrayWritable class and this class is used as the output value of the progarm.
4. Mapper is created which reads the data from the file splits the data into person and his list and then used JSONParser to parse the person and the list into Friend Object and FriendArray Object respectively. Then the pairs are craeted and mapper emits the pair and array.
5. Reducer is created which finds the common friends in the arrays send from the mapper. It then emits the friendPair and the common friend array.

## Note
The data used in this project is fictionary and randomly generated by another program.
